# Metallic Tinkering
A thingpack that adds various ores & alloys that are meant to be compatible with Tinkers' Construct.

Requires the 1.20.1 version of Json Things (Only on CurseForge Sadly).

Any suggestions or requests can go into the issues tab.

Note:
I found two of my mods (this one & Tinkers' Dolabrae) on the mcmod.cn website. Just know I didn't put them on there & will not be updating those pages as I only speak English & don't even have an account. Due to that, I also can't respond to any questions from there. These projects are mainly for fun, so they're not even in any other languages. 

I don't really care about people putting them on other sites, just leave a link to the Modrinth & GitHub.

And if your wondering what I was doing on a Chinese website as someone who doesn't know any Chinese, I was looking at some mods for Tinkers' Construct on there. Not everything gets uploaded to English sites.
